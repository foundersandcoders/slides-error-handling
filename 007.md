A little JavaScript:

What do we expect as an output from the following:

1. ```console.log( 1 + "2" + "2" );```
> "122"
2. ```console.log( +"1" + "1" + "2" )```;
> "112"
3. ```console.log( "A" - "B" + "2" );```
> "NaN2"
4. ```console.log( "A" - "B" + 2 );```
> "NaN"
5. ```console.log( {number: 6} + 10 );```
> "[object object]10"
