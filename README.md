# Talk-error-handling

I prepared a little talk to make the error handling workshop given on week 5 (node week 2) at Founders and Coders, a little less terrifying for students.

This is the one [error-handling-workshop](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/error-handling-workshop)
As this workshop requires a fair amount of reading before getting to the actual exercise and start trying the 3 approaches, giving a little introduction of the contents helps out with timing as well.

**Instructions**
 
 * Run the command ```npm install -g reveal-md``` from anywhere inside your terminal (this installs this [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reveal-md-export))
 * Clone this repo and cd into it
 * Run the command ```reveal-md```
 * A list of links will appear on a web page in your browser - the presentation is inside **000.md**, all the other files are for backup, so click there!
 * Enjoy chatting some error handling!
 
 PS: Feel free to contact me for mentor notes.
